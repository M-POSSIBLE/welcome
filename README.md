Great — the repository now becomes the first inhabitable entrance to the institute.
So the README should not read like documentation, and not like a manifesto.
It should behave like a walkway: a visitor understands in ~60 seconds what they can actually do here.

Below is a compact first version you can directly adapt.

M-Possible — Welcome

You don’t join M-Possible.
You measure into it.

M-Possible is a public experiment in which people at different levels — from school to laboratory — perform the same observation and combine their results into one shared map.

The goal is not to tell whether something is true.
The goal is to make it possible for anyone to check it themselves.

Our first anchor phenomenon is the freezing of water (the Mpemba question: can warmer water sometimes freeze sooner than colder water?).
Instead of debating answers, we compare observations made under many conditions.

⸻

What you can do here (2 minutes)
	1.	Perform a simple paired freezing test
	2.	Record one clearly defined event (“the thud”)
	3.	Submit the result
	4.	See how your observation changes the map

You do not need special equipment.
You do not need to be right.
You only need to follow the same procedure as everyone else.

How the project works

Every contribution is a measurement, not an opinion.
	•	Low-precision observations define the coastline
	•	High-precision experiments resolve its structure
	•	The shared dataset keeps both without mixing them

No single measurement proves or disproves anything.
Many measurements together show where behaviour becomes reliable.

⸻

Principles
	•	One shared definition of the event
	•	Same rules for everyone
	•	No authority required to participate
	•	The map updates — it does not conclude

⸻

Project status

This is an early-stage protocol community.
The method is being tested in the open and will change as we learn.

⸻

Why GitHub?

Because the procedure matters more than the explanation.
Everything here is versioned so anyone can see what changed and why.

⸻

If you want, the next step is the Getting-Started page — that one should be extremely concrete and almost instruction-manual-like (no philosophy at all).
